##Introduction
The W2W is an app dedicated to all of the creators or the people who produces videos as their main jobs. I have always been interested in the movie making.
People never realize small things  like transition or the camera angles can be very influential in defining the quality of the videos.
Hopefully this app can help people to gain more information about all of the creators in which they have might not even heard about.


##Use Case
Why is this app useful? As a Creator there are not many ways to advertise their quality of the videos. Many of them are underappreciated, and leaving their dream is one of the results.
In my opinion, this app can be one of the way to advertise them. Moreover, I am personally loves travelling and by looking at the videos from them
can help my mood to be better. The high quality videos in this app can be so immersive that the user might have a feeling of living inside of the video.
This app can help both the creators and the users.

##Live Site
You can access Find DJs at

##Technical
* The app is built by HTML5, JS, CSS, and jQUery.
* YouTube's API is the main source of the preview songs.
* The app is responsive where it can be easily accessed by mobile phone, tablet, and computer.
* The database of the videos will be based on the youtube.

##Road Map
The app will have an automatic update on the database, instead of depending on the developer to update the list manually.
Furthermore, in the future, the app will not only depending on the 1 API's only as their main source. There are plenty video streaming APIs
in the current market, and hopefully we can add more variaties in the app.
